### Complete list of Algorithms implemented on C++, Java and Python. This repository is just for practice purpose. 
* #### Sorting Algorithms: Sorting algorithms are used in order to arrange elements of an array in ascending (or descending) order. There are various types of sorting algorithms differentiated by their time complexities.
  * Bubble sort: It compares two adjacent elements in an array and swaps them if former is larger than latter. It's time complexity is O[n^2].
  * Selection sort: It selects smallest element and places it in an ascending order in a subarray whose size keeps on decreasing. It's time complexity is O[n^2].
  * Insertion sort: It inserts elements by comparing whether the element which needs to be inserted is greater than or less than the existing elements. It's time complexity is O[n^2].
